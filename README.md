# weather-app
Simple App designed to get generic weather condition on location specified by user input

The project was focused on retrieving info from API, so UI is a bit sad

In order to run program:
    - install requirements from `requirements.txt`, by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - setup an account at [OpenWeatherApi](https://openweathermap.org/api) and get an API key (totally free)
    - run python script with `python main.py <your API key>`
